Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
Total Accepted: 17056 Total Submissions: 49218

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
