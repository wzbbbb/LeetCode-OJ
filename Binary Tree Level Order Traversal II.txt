Total Accepted: 9651 Total Submissions: 31274

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

[
  [15,7]
  [9,20],
  [3],
]

confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
