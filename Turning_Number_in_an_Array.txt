Problem:
Turning number is the maximum number in an array which increases and then decreases. 
This kind of array is also named unimodal array. 
Please write a function which gets the index of the turning number in such an array.
For example, the turning number in array 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6} is 10, 
so its index 5 is the expected output.
