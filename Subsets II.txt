Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.

Note:

    Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,
If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
