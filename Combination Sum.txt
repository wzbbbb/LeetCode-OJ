Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:

    All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
    Elements in a combination (a1, a2, ¡­ , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ¡Ü a2 ¡Ü ¡­ ¡Ü ak).
    The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7,
A solution set is:
[7]
[2, 2, 3]
