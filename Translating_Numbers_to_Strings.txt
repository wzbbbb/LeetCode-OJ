Question:
Given a number, please translate it to a string, 
following the rules: 1 is translated to 'a', 2 to 'b', ..., 12 to 'l', ..., 26 to 'z'. 
For example, the number 12258 can be translated to "abbeh", "aveh", "abyh", "lbeh" and "lyh", 
so there are 5 different ways to translate 12258. 
How to write a function/method to count the different ways to translate a number?

seems to be using recursive function
